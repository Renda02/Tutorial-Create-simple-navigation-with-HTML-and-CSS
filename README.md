# Tutorial-Create-simple-navigation-with-HTML-and-CSS

This tutorial will guide you in creating this simple navigation using HTML and CSS.

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to develop and edit web pages. The markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within documents. 

CSS stands for CSS, a language used for describing the presentation of documents written in HTML or XML. You can use CSS style sheets to style your web pages, such as the colors, fonts, and headings.

 This tutorial requires familiarity with the following:

- Using HTML to develop basic web pages.
- Basic word processing with a text editor.
- CSS Flexbox.
- Command-line -creating a directory and a file.

### Project Set up

Follow this [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) for installing the Visual Studio Code. 

Run the following commands to create the files you need for your project:
- Create an src directory: `mkdir navigation`
- Open an src folder: `cd navigation`
- Create HTML and CSS files:  `touch index.html style.css`
-Open text editor up with:  `code .`
 
 
 ### Code Setup
 
- Open index.html to add boilerplate HTML code and CSS links.
- To create navigation, you will need to add a div container around the navigation. In addition, you will add a nav element that wraps both text tag and nested lists on the navigation.
